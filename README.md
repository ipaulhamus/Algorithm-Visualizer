# Algorithm-Visualizer
*What is it?*
This is a web application built using C# and Blazor that visualizes the process different sorting algorithms use to sort sets of integers. Once a sort completes, the application displays the best-case, average-case, and worst-case scenarios of the algorithmâ€™s sorting processes in Big O notation. 

This Visualizer Includes the Following Algorithms: 
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quicksort
- Merge Sort
- Pancake Sort
- Comb Sort
- Gnome Sort
- OddEven Sort

The source code for each algorithm includes explanations of the steps the algorithm takes in comments, allowing anyone who may view the project to understand what these algorithms are doing behind the scenes alongside the visual representations.
